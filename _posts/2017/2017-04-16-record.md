Use graphviz with pure java.

Uses this javascript version of graphviz created using Emscripten.

The javascript code is executed either with J2V8 or, as a fallback with Java 8's Nashorn engine.

Usage

The basic usage is as follows:

import static guru.nidi.graphviz.model.Factory.*;

Graph g = graph("example").directed().node(node("a").link(node("b")));
Graphviz.fromGraph(g).renderToFile(new File("example.png"));
