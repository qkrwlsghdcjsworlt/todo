Features in the electronic structure that are the hallmark of a nodal line Weyl state—a large density of linear band crossings near the Fermi level—can also be interpreted as signatures of a structural and/or magnetic instability. Indeed, it is known that Mn3ZnC undergoes transitions upon cooling from a paramagnetic to a cubic ferromagnetic state under ambient conditions and then further into a noncollinear ferrimagnetic tetragonal phase at a temperature between 250 K and 200 K.
