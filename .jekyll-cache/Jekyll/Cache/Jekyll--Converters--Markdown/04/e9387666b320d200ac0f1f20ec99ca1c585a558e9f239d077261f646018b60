<blockquote>

  <p>Features in the electronic structure that are the hallmark of a nodal line Weyl stateâ€”a large density of linear band crossings near the Fermi levelâ€”can also be interpreted as signatures of a structural and/or magnetic instability. Indeed, it is known that Mn3ZnC undergoes transitions upon cooling from a paramagnetic to a cubic ferromagnetic state under ambient conditions and then further into a noncollinear ferrimagnetic tetragonal phase at a temperature between 250 K and 200 K.</p>
